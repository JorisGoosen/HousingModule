# HousingModule
A [JASP](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop) module to calculate the difference between renting and getting a mortgage and which is more economical.

You can [download v1.0 here](https://github.com/JorisGoosen/HousingModule/archive/v1.0.tar.gz) and load it in JASP when the version > 0.10.2. For now (22-7-19) you could build jasp yourself or grab a [nightly build](http://static.jasp-stats.org/Nightlies/).
